1. Add data to the database by applying the seed data.

1. Ensure the initial tests pass by running `npm test`.

1. You can start the server with nodemon using `npm run dev` and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Now you should be ready to complete the rest of this challenge.
